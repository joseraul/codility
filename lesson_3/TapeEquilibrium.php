 * A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. Array A represents numbers on a tape.
 * Any integer P, such that 0 < P < N, splits this tape into two non-empty parts: A[0], A[1], ..., A[P − 1] and A[P], A[P + 1], ..., A[N − 1].
 * The difference between the two parts is the value of: |(A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[P − 1]) − (A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[N − 1])|
 * In other words, it is the absolute difference between the sum of the first part and the sum of the second part.

 * @param $A
